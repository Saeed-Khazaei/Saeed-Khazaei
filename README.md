##Senior Frontend Engineer & Team Leader | React.js | Next.js | TypeScript | Enterprise Architecture

I am a results-driven Senior Frontend Engineer with 6+ years of experience in building high-performance, scalable web applications. My expertise spans enterprise-level frontend architecture, modern React ecosystems (Next.js, React Query, Zustand), and design-system engineering, with a strong focus on performance optimization, accessibility, and maintainability.
Currently, as a Senior Frontend Engineer at Kavenegar, I lead large-scale frontend initiatives—migrating legacy systems to Next.js 15, architecting a comprehensive design system (Radix-UI, ShadCN), and integrating Playwright/Vitest for automated testing—resulting in measurable improvements in performance, developer efficiency, and cross-team collaboration.
Prior to this, I served as a Team Leader, mentoring developers, enforcing best practices, and driving project delivery through agile methodologies (Scrum, Jira). My leadership reduced redundancy by standardizing reusable components and fostering design-to-development alignment.

###Key Strengths
- Technical Leadership: Proven ability to architect, optimize, and scale frontend infrastructures for high-traffic applications (300% performance gains at BuyLine via code-splitting, lazy loading).
- Full-Cycle Ownership: From UI/UX design (former graphic design background) to CI/CD pipelines (Docker, GitHub Actions), I bridge gaps between design, product, and engineering.
- Cutting-Edge Tools: Deep expertise in React.js, Next.js, TypeScript, React Query, Zustand, Tailwind CSS, and testing frameworks (Vitest, Playwright).
- Collaborative Mindset: Passionate about mentoring teams, advocating for clean code, and streamlining workflows through design systems and automation.

###Career Philosophy
- User-Centric: Empathy-driven approach to crafting inclusive, intuitive experiences.
- Detail-Oriented: Obsessed with performance metrics, accessibility, and pixel-perfect execution.
- Adaptable Innovator: Thrive in dynamic environments, solving complex problems with scalable, future-proof solutions.

###Let’s connect if you’re looking for:
- A hands-on technical leader for frontend teams.
- Expertise in migrating legacy systems to modern stacks.
- A design-system advocate who unifies UI/UX and engineering.

Open to global opportunities and ambitious challenges.
