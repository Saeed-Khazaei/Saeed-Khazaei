- 📫 How to reach me ...

I started working with computers and especially graphics when I was about 17 years old. I have worked with many Adobe software and I have a relatively good command. Around 2018, my friends and I launched a start-up in the field of villa rental, and at the same time, I went to product design. But due to the lack of knowledge and the existence of a gap between programmers and graphic designers, I had to start programming myself. During this time, which was about 3-4 years since I started my career in the field of programming, I was able to manage successful projects and make good progress. The main focus of the software development I did was on the web, but I also had several versions of the application. I am currently working in a company as the head of the front development team, but I feel the need to face bigger challenges.
